  Mavens & Aficionados, an extension of the Maple & Ash steakhouse brand, is an exclusive wine club for wine enthusiasts. The mobile app was to be an integral part of the club experience and I worked to define an aesthetic that reflected the Maple & Ash brand, while expanding it to meet the needs of a mobile application.
