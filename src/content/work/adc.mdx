  Applied Data Corp’s SaaS software for grocery retailers and food manufacturers needed a facelift. I designed a fresh interface for their web application and suggested UX improvements for targeted user flows. This work was eventually used in the development of a pattern library provided to ADC’s engineers.

  - title: Clear data hierarchy
    description: Through several iterations, I was able to provide a clean and digestible data hierarchy that would allow users to quickly find key pieces of data.

  - title: Repeatable UI patterns
    description: I broke all screens down into key patterns and repeatable components, to allow my colleagues at World HQ to produce a pattern library — a key final deliverable for the client.
