title: Test Project
description: Sloan, a 110-year-old global commercial restroom supplier, needed a modern website that would cater to both designers and engineers. As part of the World HQ team, I created a website design based on the Sloan brand, implemented a custom Drupal 8 theme, and developed enhancements like Algolia-powered search and a realtime spec sheet generator.
role: UI/UX Design & Front-end Build
