  Sloan, a 110-year-old global commercial restroom supplier, needed a modern
  website that would cater to both designers and engineers. As part of the World
  HQ team, I created a website design based on the Sloan brand, implemented a
  custom Drupal 8 theme, and developed enhancements like Algolia-powered search
  and a real-time spec sheet generator.
