  Arktura, a manufacturer of cutting-edge architectural systems, needed a website that accurately reflected the innovative nature of their brand. Working with the World HQ team, I helped design new website features and views, build a custom Wordpress theme, and enhance their site with a product library and Google map-based rep finder.
