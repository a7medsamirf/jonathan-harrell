bio: >-
  I’m a UI/UX designer and front-end developer working in Chicago, building
  websites and applications for clients large and small. I’ve been interested in
  creating things on the web for most of my life, but I’ve been working
  seriously at it for the last six years. My true passion is the intersection
  point between design and development, when something flat and static becomes a
  real, usable thing.

        Sometimes I write for the LogRocket blog, a great information resource
        for front-end developers. LogRocket is an advanced error tracking and
        session recording service.
