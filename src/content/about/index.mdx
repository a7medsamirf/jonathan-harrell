bio: >-
  I’m a UI/UX designer and front-end developer working in Chicago, building
  websites and applications for clients large and small. I’ve been interested in
  creating things on the web for most of my life, but I’ve been working
  seriously at it for the last four years. From a technical standpoint, I spend
  most of my time working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My true passion is the
  intersection point between design and development, when something flat and
  static becomes a real, usable thing.

        styles for developers to quickly get started called HiQ.

        Sometimes I write for the LogRocket blog, a great information resource
        for front-end developers. LogRocket is an advanced error tracking and
        session recording service.
